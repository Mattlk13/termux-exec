## Changelog

**Commit history:** [`v2.1.0...v2.2.0`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0)

&nbsp;



### Fixed

- system-linker-exec: Reattempt fix done in 2f6d9f92 to assume app data file execute restrictions are exempted if `/proc/self/attr/current` is not accessible as SeLinux may not be supported on the device. ([`b566e7ff`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/commit/b566e7ff))
- exec-intercept: Do not open system executables to read file header and do not abort `execve` if file header is not readable for non-system executables due to `ENOENT`. ([`3300bfba`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/commit/3300bfba))
