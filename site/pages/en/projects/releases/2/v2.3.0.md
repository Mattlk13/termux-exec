### Fixed

- ExecIntercept: Fix `LD_VARS` not being unset for system executables if executed with `fexecve()` or fd path, and their file header being read instead of skipped as per ([`3300bfba`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/commit/3300bfba)). ([`4477568e`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/commit/4477568e))  

- ExecIntercept: Fix issue on at least on Android `<= 7`, where running commands with empty `$LD_PRELOAD` variable, like `LD_PRELOAD= <command>` will fail with `CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE` errors with a random environment variable `<name=value>` pair or `DT_RUNPATH` directory loaded as a library. ([`760ff6e4`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/commit/760ff6e4))  

- ExecIntercept: Return `Permission denied (EACCES)` if executing a non-regular file instead of `Is a directory (EISDIR)` for a directory. Related commit https://github.com/termux/termux-core-package/commit/1779618b. Closes [#33](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/issues/33). ([`577ffd96`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/commit/577ffd96))  

- ExecIntercept_RuntimeBinaryTests: Do not log failure logs to stdout of parent and log them to original stderr of child, otherwise they would get captured in `output` of parent and compared with `output_regex`. ([`0f0866e7`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec-package/commit/0f0866e7))
